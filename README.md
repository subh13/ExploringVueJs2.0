# ExploringVueJs2.0
This repo has been created for education purposes only. To learn and explore the things about Vue Js
Directives
v-on:input : when you give some input to any input field this event fired.
v-bind     : this directive tells html dom element that that should access the value from vue js not normally.
v-once     : this directive helps if one variable is updated later on with some new value it defends that variable to be overwritten.
v-html     : Renders html code from vue js rather than normal text
eventlisteners and event modifiers: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/events.html#Event-Modifiers
v-model    : this binds the value of a variable with a control
computed   : this property prevents vue js to use the whole page for a single function which is not actually executing. Rather than method property somebody can write the function inside of computed rather than method.
watch     : this property react to each changes which has been done to variable or similar asynchronously.
shorthand : use @ sign at the place of v-on:click like @click. v-on:href could be :href like this way.
